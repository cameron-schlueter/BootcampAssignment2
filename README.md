# Description
 Hello World! This is my second MSU Bootcamp project that primarily revolves around using HTML and CSS to create a Professional Portolio. 





## First Submission Grading Notes

Application doesn't include a photo or avatar of the student  
The application's navigation doesn't include links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them  
The application's navigation doesn't link to each corresponding section on the page  
The section about the student's work doesn't contain titled images of the student's applications (or placeholders)  
In the application's section about their work, the first image isn't larger in size than the others  
Clicking on a featured application doesn't open that deployed application (at least one application, in case they are using placeholders).  
Repo doesn't include a high quality README with screenshots, a description, link to deployed application  
Code doesn't follow recommended file/folder structure 
Code doesn't follow good practices for class/id names, indentation, lacks quality comments
