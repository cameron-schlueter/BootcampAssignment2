# Description
 Hello World! This is my second MSU Bootcamp project that primarily revolves around using HTML and CSS to create a Professional Portolio. 

# Contact Information
You can find my Linked-In on the portfolio, please feel free to send a message with any comments or concerns. I will try to answer as time allows. If you are a grader, I will read your comments attached to the next grade.

# Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
